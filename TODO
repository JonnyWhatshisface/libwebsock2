* Create a "lws_scheduler_get_wrapper" function to return pointer to wrapper.
   - Need to pre-allocate X amount of wrappers and reuse them to cut down malloc() calls
   - Need to increase allocated wrapper count as needed, and clear them as they're no longer
     in demand

* Implement VM for pre-allocated wrappers to increase performance and maximize memory performance.

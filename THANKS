Special thanks goes to Payden Kyle Sutherland for original
conception and design.

Payden Kyle Sutherland started this project with the goal
of creating an easy to work with websocket library that would
handle all of the RFC6455 protocol specifications for the user.
His work paved the way for what is now libwebsock v2.0 . Payden
unfortunately passed away at a very early age, only 27 years old.

Jonathan Hall, who was using libwebsock for testing of a new idea,
picked up his work and continued it. It is with libwebsock that
Payden Kyle Sutherland will be forever eternally amongst us, and
his brilliant conception will continue to serve those now and in
to the future.

Though the entire core was re-written and enhanced, Payden's
work set the bar and paved the way for the direction the
project ultimately ended up going. With that being said,
this library exists because of him, and full credit is given
to him and to his family.

Though licensed under the GPL free software license, it is
requested that if you use this product to make a profit,
you kindly donate to his family.
